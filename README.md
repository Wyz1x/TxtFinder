# TxtFinder

This is a simple tool to search for specific information within `.txt` files located in a directory. It allows you to enter search terms, and it will display all lines in the files that match the search query. It also works for searching through a single `.txt` file.

## Features

- Search for specific information within `.txt` files.
- Case-insensitive search.
- Allows searching for full names or any information present in the text files.
- Simple command-line interface.
- If no results are found, a "404" message is displayed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/database-search-tool.git]
```
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Place the .txt files you want to search through in the same directory as the Python script or specify the correct file path.

Usage
Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the directory where the script is located.

Run the Python script:

  ```bash
  python main.py
  Enter the information (name or any keyword) you want to search for when prompted.
  ```

If a match is found, the program will display the corresponding line(s). If no match is found, it will show "404".

Type exit to quit the program.
